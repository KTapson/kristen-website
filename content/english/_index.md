# About 

My research focuses on post-WWII poetry and science with an emphasis on experimental practice across discourses. Currently, my interests traverse ecopoetics, laboratory science, feminist technoscience, histories of scientific instrumentation, and avant-garde art and writing associated with practices of research, particularly as they relate to the natural sciences. These interests are directed toward examining how durational forms of collaboration can support exchanges between practices of art and science across scales. In my writing studies and public humanities work, I aim to scaffold critical-collaborative models of collectivity and explore community-oriented research from within its practice.

My first book project, [***Enduring Experiments***](/books), investigates a shared trajectory across the poetry of Clark Coolidge and Bernadette Mayer, taking both poets seriously as researchers whose complex ways of interacting with their own laboriously generated poetic milieus challenge the limits of existing models for describing post-WWII poetryâ€™s engagement with experimental science. Throughout the book, I bring the discourse on experiment in science studies into contact with poetics, showing how experimental poetry can be a surprising source for alternative concepts of scientific subjectivity. Overlapping my work on *Enduring Experiments,* I co-edited (with Stephanie Anderson) the expansive Coolidge-Mayer correspondence, which extends across three decades.

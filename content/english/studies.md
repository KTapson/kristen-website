My current research includes three practice-based projects, each one centering on an alternative reading of a key work by a particular experimental artist or scientist. These works are Henry S. Fitch's _Autecology of the Copperhead_ (1960), Lee Lozano's daily notebooks from the late 1960s, and J.H. van't Hoff's theory of the tetrahedral carbon and his related lecture _Imagination in Science_ (1878). In the descriptions that follow, I contextualize these projects and address some of the ways I understand them to relate to one another.

## Another Autecology of the Copperhead

>Despite persistent effort to study the copperhead, progress was slow, especially in the early stages of the investigation. Copperheads were rarely seen engaged in their normal activities, and even when such individuals were found, observing them proved remarkably unrewarding. A copperhead found by chance usually lay motionless for long periods either having “frozen” in the usual reaction to any alarm, or merely resting&mdash;the sluggish behavior that is characteristic of the species. Attempting to observe such a snake severely tried the patience of the investigator. When the snake finally began to move, it might soon be irretrievably lost because of the perfection with which it blended with its background, and the dense concealing vegetation and other cover in the situations frequented.

## Lab Notebook Prototyping

>“Art museum on one side & a science frontier research lab on the other.”   
>&mdash; Lee Lozano, _Private Book 5_

I adore Lee Lozano's jubilant, science-inflected note-taking practice.

Her notes, which almost always include the date, resemble lab notebook writing. Sometimes, in fact, she writes in actual lab notebooks. Known as a conceptual artist and perhaps most famous for dropping out of the New York scene and moving home to Texas at what could have been the height of her fame, her work is not generally considered in the context of her interest in physical science or her sense of experiment as an iterative, transformative artistic form. Just as a scientist collages documentation, data, samples, spectra, and repetitive experimental techniques in their lab notebooks, Lozano documents her life and ideas meticulously, as if she can only sustain herself through continuous writing. In the process, she proves herself to be self-experimental to a fault. My project on Lozano's work is oriented toward prototyping her ideas for apparatuses or wearable tech, treating her notes as if they were truly written in a scientific lab notebook. That is, I imagine that her ideas were written to be reiterated in ways that manifest her scientific sensibility and commitments as an artist while going beyond the possibilities for meaning in their moment. 

My approach to Lozano's work began with close study of the published facsimiles of her nine small memobooks. She uses these memobooks as diaries, day planners, and commonplace books in which she jots down addresses, phone numbers, random thoughts, unit conversions, conversation snippets, reading reflections, unattributed quotes, event reviews, and up-to-the-minute commentary. Her notes from 1968 to 1970 cover more than 300 tiny pages. These are not the notes of an ingénue just landing on the scene; Lozano is 37 when she begins Book 1, 39 when she completes Book 9, and 41 when she edits the entire series of notebooks. She changes her process in Book 4, leaving the back of each page blank for adding notes later.

Her notes are detailed, passionate, funny, endearingly odd, and wide ranging in focus. She moves quickly between topics and emotional registers. Ideation is her practice. What do these notes include? A table documenting her daily cigarette consumption, a contentious exchange with her vacuum cleaner (spoiler: it sucks), new origin stories for bodily functions (“Stomach gurgling is really the sound of our whole digestive tract laughing hysterically at us”), acknowledgments of precarious mental state (“my mind snapped, my ribbon reversed”) and even some curiously lavish attention paid to a worm she finds in her weed stash, which culminates in a page of enthusiastic proclamations announcing the emergence of a culture of recreational worm watching: “I’m a worm watcher. Worm watching becomes a new fad! Worm watching sweeps the country!” (Book 4, p. 68). She sometimes makes definitive statements and then refers back to them later, conscious that she is contradicting herself. On May 2, ’68, for example, she writes, “I decided that I do not want to live with a man (or anybody else).” She follows up on this statement a year later, on May 6, ’69: “Maybe it’d be fun to live with a man again providing we each had our own separate place also.” Sometimes she addresses a particular friend, and it is unclear whether she is documenting an actual conversation, making a note-to-self for later, or projecting herself into a conversation and improvising her friend’s presumed response. In other words, we do not know much about the context for many of her notes, even though they often suggest conversational immediacy: “Ed, do you think I’d be bullshitting too much if I said I was studying mathematics? It’s more like I’m studying mathematicians.” (Bk 9, p. 33).

Writing in her notebooks often seems to provide a consciously discontinuous framework for wandering within her mental processing that only later resurfaces into an empirical situation that can prompt a new art-life piece. Levity and continuity of work certainly intercede to buoy difficult moments throughout her notebooks, however. This is an artist who&mdash;with a serious wink&mdash;calls herself a “highentist.” “Continue to work on getting rid of gravity,” she writes on Jan 3, 1970. Lozano’s commitment to these kinds of idealistic statements is notable; she clearly goes through difficult times. Even as she deals with serious financial hardship, for example, she documents it as part of her work. (She proposes LETSF&mdash;or, the Lozano Emergency T.S.* Fund&mdash;where T.S. stands for “tough shit you’re out of cash” (_Language Pieces_).

Lozano takes science seriously. And she takes play with scientific concepts and sources seriously in her work. She trained in physics as an undergraduate.  She references _Physics Today_, _Scientific American_, _The Physical Foundations of General Relativity_, and more in her writing. And while her art practice necessitates that she "compromise" herself repeatedly by subjecting herself to self-experimental conditions imposed by daily life, she is notoriously uncompromising in her choice of materials. Finding out that her favorite paints are going out of production leads her to completely rethink the future of her art practice: "re the discontinuing of shiva standard line of ferrous colors: undercurrent of excitement at prospect of being forced to make a change due to circumstances entirely beyond my control” (Book 2, p. 29). Later, she writes, “Decision that I will stop painting when the shiva standard oil ferrous line of colors runs out” (89).

Despite multiple references in her notebooks to various conditions that would lead her to give up painting, she seems genuinely inspired by everything. And sometimes that tendency toward inspiration and ideation gets in the way of expected etiquette. Reporting on a conversation with Richard Serra, her friend and an artist she respects, for example, she gives a somewhat brutal review of the opening of his solo exhibition at Castelli Warehouse in late 1969 that includes her thoughts on what she would have done differently. 

> <ins> Dec 16, 69</ins>  
Serra’s warehouse show did not give a trip. Some of the pieces were exciting & most of the people were uptight (till I passed the grass, maybe.) The show looked like “art floor,” dept store. (Why not set up that show in a real warehouse with huge crates or such?). Ropes made it worse.
>
> <ins> Dec 17, 69</ins>    
Serra called & I told him some of this but not the real warehouse idea which I just now got. (Bk 5, p. 15-16)

Her notes also indicate rapid shifts in her fortune as an artist as well as the degree to which her projects contribute to her well-being or not. Following an enthusiastic proposal for a utopian project and clear hopefulness about its realization, for example, her work takes a sharp turn:

> My work (Grass, No-Grass, Genl Strke, Dialogues) is making me insane. The last three days have brought out my insanity neatly. I think everybody else is a little insane too, but I realize tonight that my image of how the world is, is inaccurate. Part of my insanity is violent paranoia attacks. My phone went dead, (no one called except Dan), I got no mail, & the mental dissolution was immediately precipitated. Then tonight, three days later, a flurry of activity & I instantly feel better. Right now I seem to be dependent on communicating with people for my mental health. It is some need to get info out, to engage, not to brood. (Book 2, p. 80)

Lozano acknowledges significant vulnerability and insight here as she reflects on the importance of social interaction, even as she also references a significant but unspecified break with “my image of how the world is” and its subsequent impact. We do not have access to more information about what feeling “insane” means for Lozano either, though she mentions that it involves paranoia. Regardless of cause or manifestation, she adds a note on the opposite page, shifting the project toward repair and self-protection rather than declaring an end to the piece. Continuation of the work becomes the act of making a safety plan: “Paranoia Kit Piece Make a Paranoia Kit & keep it around for use (or reference) when you feel an attack coming on.” (80A)

Lozano seems to be highly affected by her environment. As a result of this aspect of her being, she has to carefully choose the environments in which she immerses herself and participates. Sometimes, it seems, this sensitivity needs to be protected. Sometimes, though, it seems to offer her access to scales of experience beyond the human. 

Her notes implicitly model her ethical commitments without moralizing or imposing them on others. For example, notes such as “all weapons are boomerangs” and “don’t hit back without love” suggest Lozano’s rejection of intentional violence regardless of justification. Humor is a tool she uses to diffuse the imposition of end-directed controls and to disrupt normative modes of perception surrounding mundane everyday experiences with an earnest grappling that often emerges, counterintuitively, through the artifice of her project setups. In this way, her approach to everyday phenomena and devotion to actively generating experiences of wonder within the ostensibly mundane everyday overlaps with something like Bernadette Mayer's "Found poems" prompt in _The Art of Science Writing_ : "a specimen, no matter how mundane or small, removed from its context and examined closely, becomes much more interesting. When it is returned to its context, the context becomes more interesting, too" (73). Sometimes Lozano herself is the specimen, but she always seems determined to forge physical connections to nonintuitive, and nonhuman, matters of daily life.

Two themes in Lozano's writing are of particular interest to me: her invocations of nonhuman forms of embodiment and her commitment to technologically-mediated forms of transparency. Her work is always closer to critical anthropomorphism than it is to a simple translation of phenomena to human use or control. And with regard to transparency, her straightforward way of communicating (quite nicely) obscures a complex sense of the procedures that might make something more transparent: 

> Middle-of-the-night thoughts: “Random cant-sleep-due-to-brain-overload-thoughts: since I’ve been consuming much more oil in my diet (& on my body) I seem to be getting more transparent. (oil spots on paper are transparent, etc). Want more transparency! (See Light Piece & fantasy abt matter becoming more transparent the more light on it. Also description of lit rose, Physics Today BK review) Emotions/needs/ideas &mdash;> More transparent!  (Book 7)

Here, she is likely registering a connection between oil paints and oil-based foods too, and she seems to insinctively rethink that connection in terms of their relationship to (counterintuitively) producing literal transparency. Lozano expresses interest in accessing the inside of the "human container" in new ways&mdash;or just _some_ way. That is, she clearly values a straightforward definition of transparency even as she seems to acknowledge the layers of mediation or augmentation that might be necessary to achieve it. One aspect of her work that interests me quite a lot is the way she seeks alternatives to language for communicating what is happening inside the body emotionally or physically. She seems motivated by a desire to access every scale of experience and to create personal models of communication between interior and exterior.

{{< figure src="/images/LL1Page6.jpg" alt="LL1Page6" class="right" >}}

In keeping with Lozano's investment in physical science generally and molecular and atomic scales more specifically, she is amusingly unconvinced by any suggestion of the human form's evolutionary excellence:

> Whoever or whatever designed human beings and all evolutionary forms that led up to them was a bad artist who took the idea of form follows            function to its ultimate disaster. Any rumination about mankind’s shape will disclose how exceedingly ugly a human is ... If we were more              intelligent we would be shaped like spheres which at rest had perhaps smooth reflective surfaces. We could change from solid to liquid to              gaseous states of matter or become nothing but a charge or a force. Our material & color would vary at our will, we’d roll, float or fly. (Book 1)

She elaborates on these notes elsewhere on the same day, and that extended version is collected among her _Language Pieces_. In this version, her first paragraph above is her “Prologue,” and what follows is a more substantive dive into what she calls “redesign the human being suggestions”: 

> Substitute a dashboard or a control panel for the face. Let it be easily accessable for scanning by the host as well as other beings. On the           control panel are gauges & dials indicating continuously changing states of temperature, respiration, metabolism, pulserate, heartbeat,               adrenalin count, gonad charge, balance & many other body systems. This info being readily accessible to all might eliminate the peculiarly human       habit of telling lies, the tiresome question “how are you?”

I treat Lozano's ideation here as the groundwork for building prototypes. That is, I propose to bring her work into the context of bioengineering, asking how she might have enacted a proposal like the one above while also incorporating implicit features of her notebook writing into the model. Amplifying Lozano's investment in self-experiment as well as her desire to never "lessen" anyone, I interpet her work as fundamentally concerned with generating circuits of care. In her life, however, Lozano's model of care was not particularly self-sustaining. My experiments will attempt to complicate the connections between the circuitry of the proposed device and the living organism it measures (Lozano), orienting experiments toward harnessing bioelectricity and generating transformative feedback loops in ways that draw from current experimentation in [user-device design](https://jasminelu.site/Integrating-Living-Organisms-in-Devices-to-Implement-Care-based). The result will aim to manifest Lozano and then _more_ Lozano in an experimental exploration of affect. Lozano squared. My approach to her work is similar to my approach to the work of other artists and scientists: rather than dismissing an ostensibly strange idea, what if we (carefully) took it really, really seriously in a carefully-selected context? What new sense could be made? In the case of Lozano: why have authenticity on one scale when you can have (weirder) authenticity on multiple, potentially competing scales? (_"How are you?"_) Could it add up to new modes of relating to each other? I think of myself as caring for Lozano's distinctive note-taking practice by noticing interesting themes and features that she may not have noticed herself; then, I amplify those features and feed them back into her work as a model of interventional, retroactive collaboration. 

Lozano clearly never invests much in the culture of celebrity or fame, and despite criticism and speculation regarding her mental state, she lives out the ethics to which she commits herself. Perhaps as a result, the physics of everyday life and suggestions for alternative embodiment and participation in everyday life that animate her notebook pages never actually materialize as significant throughlines in her work. What she leaves behind in her notebooks, however, is the outline of unpursued experimental trajectories artist-scientists today can pick up, reference, and adapt. Through her self-sampling and sustained interest in _matter_, for example, she repeatedly glimpses the beginnings of alternative sign systems and pushes to make that project legible, at least to herself, in the context of existing frameworks. Undoubtedly, this research trajectory would have been richer had she pursued and documented it herself in the context of her idiosyncratic version of everyday physical science. When she is writing at arguably her most interesting, I would like to suggest, she directs sustained attention to the physical world, reimagining the terms of human sociality and connection from the groundwork of these observations.


## Stereopoetry

>"Science is practical in the highest sense of the word."   
>&mdash; J.H. van't Hoff, _Imagination in Science_

For a long time, I have been fascinated with molecular shape. Alkenes are planar. Carbons are tetrahedral. Relatedly, I am drawn to a particular moment in the history of science: the emergence of stereochemistry as a field within structural organic chemistry in the late nineteenth century. With the proposal for the tetrahedral shape of carbon, J.H. van't Hoff intervened into the trajectory of the discipline, making consideration of the spatial arrangement of atoms (rather than just connectivity) into a new fundamental on which to build an understanding of molecular interactions and reactivity. New terms emerged, like "enantiomer" and "chirality." Later, this proposal would become a new basis for modern biochemistry, as the body is composed of single-enantiomer chiral molecules&mdash;meaning molecules that are nonsuperimposable mirror images and therefore have a particular fundamental orientation in space, like the right and left hand. See also: Robert Smithson's _Enantiomorphic Chambers_ (1965).

In the language of organic chemistry, connectivity dictates shape&mdash;connectivity is analogous to shape&mdash;and without its thorough consideration, one cannot understand the bigger picture of higher order function and meaning. I am motivated to return to fundamental considerations of the matter of language, scientific experiment, and a broad concept of shape beyond the referential field of the human, on the one hand, as well as a commitment to exploring the concepts of conservation, pataphysics, and the recycling of scientific concepts, on the other. With this motivation in mind, I conceptualized a project, which I plan to present alongside student work in the spring exhibition for our [Laboratory Art in Practice](https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project-teams/laboratory-art-practice-building-model-artscience-lab-duke-2022-2023) Bass Connection team, that returns not only to the details of van't Hoff's theory of the tetrahedral carbon as a site for proliferating concepts of reading and poetic meaning-making but also to the way he shared his theory &mdash;foldable cardboard models sent through the mail&mdash;to convince other scientists of the validity of his proposal. Essentially, my intention is to take the groundwork of his theory seriously in a completely different context. The stakes are an alphabet of relations.

Some personal history guides me: in my first semester of graduate school, I wrote an essay historicizing the concept of imagination across literary and scientific texts for my cohort's proseminar. (At the time of the presentation, I think I was 22 years old). I did a hybrid science-lit chalk talk that  included drawing molecular models on the board. I remember the room getting pretty quiet afterward. We had been talking about literary theory all semester. Finally, a friend gently suggested that I should return to Derrida's critique of Lévi-Strauss. She was too nice to say so explicitly, but the implication was that my project was hopelessly regressive in its attempt to collide a key moment in the history of structural organic chemistry (emphasis on _structural_) with key moments in literary theory. I was becoming an advocate for something that had already been disproven. I thought my friends were probably right, and my proposal was by no means perfect, so I put aside the thought of this mode of exploration, and I _was_ able to complicate my views as I became more disciplined.

Yet, I also hoped to have support for my work that would allow me hold onto this interest in real scientific practice while exploring something that could actually mobilize its possibility. (The relationship between structuralism and shape means something different in the context of literature versus the context of molecules). And I never lost my energy for, and attentiveness to, moments when a person encounters a new-to-them field without any immersion in its taken-for-granted fundamentals and presents a natural yet radical alternative vision. New fields can form or organize this way. This enduring commitment to interdisciplinary encounters forms a crucial pillar of my approach to pedagogy. I often work with students who are trying to navigate their passion for serious (and sometimes seriously playful) considerations of scientific practice in the context of art while also grappling with a desire for a space to experiment with queering scientific practice in various ways. When you are working in a space or a sign system that might quickly, and incorrectly, subsume novelty under existing frameworks, I have found it to be essential to have supporters who will hold space for possibility. "What you have to do is generate the criteria for your own reception," I say, always properly attributing the quote to my training, and then I watch with pleasure as my students react with enthusiasm to this prospect, usually writing down the instruction. 

Now, I would like to turn somewhat abruptly to the significant and peculiar moment in the history of structural organic chemistry that I referenced above as a way of sharing my enthusiasm for my own project while also proposing that similar orientations already exist but may not frame themselves as projects with a connection to science or scientific controversy. Alan J. Rocke's sympathetic book on German chemist Hermann Kolbe is particularly helpful in drawing attention to the circumstances surrounding the controversial reception of van't Hoff's theory of the tetrahedral carbon:

> A sketch of the theory was published in Dutch in 1874, and a longer French version appeared the next year. The first enthusiastic advocate of van't Hoff's theory was Johannes Wislicenus, professor at Wurzburg, who was a mid-career structural organic chemist with a fine reputation; he had even published some thoughts on three-dimensional (physical) isomerism himself. Wislicenus asked his student F. Hermann to prepare a German translation of van't Hoff's "Chemistry in Space," wrote an enthusiastic preface, and sold the work to Vieweg Verlag. Kolbe found out about this translation almost immediately because the Vieweg company had a long-established policy of automatically sending proof sheets of all their organic-chemical publications to Kolbe. (328)

Kolbe, with no personal justification for disliking van't Hoff, therefore encounters the theory early in its reception. In response, he publicly (in print) mocks, taunts, and pathologizes van't Hoff. Consistently, he attacks where he perceives weakness. While I am reluctant to emphasize Kolbe's sustained criticism, I do want to draw attention to the details of the situation's unfolding in order to then refocus attention on the way van't Hoff later incorporates this critique into his position on the nature of experimentation. As Rocke points out, van't Hoff embodied a particularly infuriating form of researcher to Kolbe: "Kolbe found his ideal model for the "metachemist" pursuing "transcendental chemistry" when the then-unknown J.H. van't Hoff unveiled his theory of the asymmetric carbon atom, the first step toward chemistry considered in three dimensions&mdash;soon to be called stereo-chemistry. Van't Hoff, who had studied with Kekulé and Wurtz, first found employment at the Utrecht Veterinary College..." (328).

Famously, Kolbe takes aim at van't Hoff in lively, personal terms:

> A Dr. J.H. van't Hoff who is employed at the Veterinary School in Utrecht appears to find exact chemical research not suiting his taste. He deems it more convenient to mount Pegasus (apparently borrowed from the Veterinary School) and proclaim in his _'La chimie dans l'espace'_ how, in his bold flight to the top of the chemical Parnassus, the atoms appeared to him to be arranged in cosmic space. (329)

In other words, Kolbe clearly has great fun with van't Hoff's inferior position. (The modern-day equivalent of such a status-oriented dismissal might be something like using the term "adjunct professor" as a pejorative, though we might expect it to be less memorable than the image Kolbe offers). He states that van't Hoff's pamphlet "teems with fantastic trifles" and "it is completely impossible to criticize [it] in any detail because the fancy trifles in it are totally devoid of any factual reality and are completely incomprehensible to any clear-minded resarcher" (6-7). "It is a sign of the times," he writes, "that modern chemists feel the urge and capability to have an explanation for everything and if gained experience does not suffice, then they are perfectly happy to invoke supernatural explanations" (7). Even Wislicenus, mentioned above for his good reputation, becomes a figure Kolbe can use to dismiss van't Hoff before reversing the poles and thoroughly dismissing Wislicenus:

> As already stated, I would have ignored this paper if not, incomprehensibly, Wislicenus had provided it with a preprinted preface in which he, by no means jokingly but quite seriously and warmly, recommended this paper as meritorious accomplishment .... Wislicenus therefore declares herewith that he has withdrawn from the ranks of exact natural scientists and changed over to the camp of the natural philosophers of ominous remembrance, which are only separated by a thin "medium" from the spiritualists.

As Rocke demonstrates, the controversy becomes a key topic in the scientific correspondence at the time. Wislicenus, in fact, intervenes directly on van't Hoff's behalf in an 1877 letter to Kolbe:

> You cannot possibly have studied van't Hoff's essay ... [for] how else could you have reproached me (by logic I do not understand) for a tendency toward spiritualism, or held against the young van't Hoff his position at a veterinary school, or against the translator Herrmann, who was my assistant and solely due to pressing external circumstances accepted a position at the agricultural institute in Heidelberg! I have never doubted that it is a holy zeal for the truth that guides your critical pen; but on the other hand I regret that you do not seem to concede any possibility of your own fallibility, which everyone must grant ... I know that I can err, but I also know that I have no cause to allow myself to be struck from the ranks of exact scientists, for I as well as you have the will to serve the truth ... (332-33).

Kolbe elsewhere rails against August Kekulé&mdash;who is perhaps most well known now for dreaming of a snake eating its tail and subsequently conceptualization of the ring shape of benzene&mdash;which draws Kolbe's former student Jacob Volhard into the fray: 

> And as for the form, I ask you: What do you care about Kekulé's style or his classical education? Consideration for K's scientific accomplishments, indeed mere collegial respect ought to have stopped you from treating this man as if you were a teacher looking over a schoolboy's assignments and correcting his mistakes .... I beseech you, no more such intemperate critiques! More tolerance and respect for scientists who have made and are still making their contributions! (332)

Time and time again, Kolbe begins with an assumption about the right answer and correct outcome, then he exerts his authority and control to enforce his worldview regardless of the cost. But, importantly here, he ends up being wrong about the science. A new field was opening up.  

{{< figure src="/images/imagination_in_science.jpg" alt="Imagination in Science cover" class="right" >}}

Van't Hoff most famously addresses Kolbe's criticism in 1878 in the inaugural lecture upon his appointment to the faculty at the University of Amersterdam. He calls this lecture [_Imagination in Science_](https://www.ias.ac.in/public/Volumes/reso/012/05/0088-0100.pdf). To begin, he reads Kolbe's criticism in full. Then, he pivots: "Here is not the place to discuss further this vast divergence of views; nevertheless, I have mentioned it, since it formed the main reason for the choice of my subject: **Imagination in Science**"

In the first half of his talk, van't Hoff defines experiment and asserts its value. That is, he does not spend any time arguing for the validity of his theory of the asymmetric carbon or directly championing it. Kolbe's main problem with van't Hoff seems to be the lack of what he considered to be sufficient empirical evidence to support a paradigm-altering theory. Van't Hoff's theory was indeed based on published&mdash;and therefore very real&mdash;experimental data. Kolbe, circumscribing the terms of the possible, essentially puts forward the argument that van't hoff did not have the kind of impressive university position or experience in the discipline that would be necessary to truly understand the limits of the field. Concomitant with an understanding of the limits of the field would be an understanding of the limits of knowledge. Thus, what seemed to particularly anger Kolbe was the "insolence" with which van't Hoff synthesized published data in order to project to a new theory and therefore a new domain of experimentation and investigation. Van't Hoff's theory threatened not only Kolbe's worldview but also his methodology. Experiment, in other words, was Kolbe's domain.

Van’t Hoff begins by directly addressesing the definition of experiment, summarizing the scope of his talk as “_The role of the imagination in investigating the connection between cause and effect_” (8). He situates the terms of experiment as he understands them and presents examples from the history of science that illustrate limit cases and innovations. He references the logic by which Helmholtz invented the ophthalmoscope, for instance, exemplifying a productive "synergism of imagination and critical judgment":  

There is a difficulty which makes it impossible to observe the retina through the pupil although the latter is completely translucent. The difficulty is that precisely during observation, as the idiom states, one stands in one's own light. A flame put between the observed and the observing eye would illuminate the former but make its observation impossible. _The thought occurred to_ HELMHOLTZ's _mind_ to place between both eyes a small mirror with a small aperture in such a way that a lateral light beam would fall in the subject's eye which now can be observed through the aperture. (9-10) 

Imagination, van't Hoff argues, "plays a role both in the ability to do scientific research as well as in the urge to exploit this capability" (12). Summarizing the results of an inquiry into the biographies of famous scientists across history, he points out that two criteria characterize the scientists who contributed the most significant theories and discoveries to their fields: first, _artistic inclinations_, and second, (what van't Hoff calls) _the diseased imagination_ (15). With regard to the former, he surveys great scientists' enthusiasm and talents for poetry, storytelling, and theatre. With regard to the latter, he notes that "examples of the most bizarre imagination, superstition, spiritualism, hallucinations, even insanity, occur not infrequently in the examined biographies (15-16). As he continues, the examples become quite strange: "Newton always was afraid that an accident would befall him in a carriage and thus held himself onto the door. Kepler's conception of the universe was most peculiar; he seriously believed the earth to be a reptile and that the planets which surround the earth produce a melodious chord by their movement (Jupiter and Saturn form the bass, Mars the tenor, and so on)." 

Finally, van't Hoff turns to the current state of scientific research, arguing that the expanding field of researchers changes both the pathway to scientific discovery and the role of the imagination in conducting scientific work. Imagination has become less necessary to the scientific enterprise: "If the diaphragm, which plays the predominant role in breathing, is artificially paralyzed, then the chest takes over for a while the work of the diaphragm as best it can. If imagination is lacking, then one tries by other means to compensate for this deficiency" (17).

He concludes the talk with a comparison between two scientists:

> At the end of a biography CUVIER once compared two great chemists, VAUQUELIN and DAVY; he expressed himself         about as follows: “Notwithstanding his innumerable investigations and in spite of the important and noteworthy     observations with which VAUQUELIN enlarged the stock of scientific knowledge, he cannot be considered as of the     same caliber as DAVY. The former put his name in the paragraphs; the latter in the titles of each chapter. In a     completely unpretentious manner, the former observed with a lantern the smallest obscurities and penetrated into the darkest nooks; the latter ascended like an eagle and illuminated the large realm of physics and           chemistry with a shining beacon.” (18)
    
Following this comparison between the experimental contributions of Vauquelin and Davy, van't Hoff expresses unmitigated optimism:
    
> I make these words my own in order to describe what research is without imagination, and what it can be if one uses  it in an admissible manner. VAUQUELIN did not appear in the two classifications above; DAVY, however, did in both as poet as well as visionary. His discoveries were the fruits of that great gift which [H.T.] BUCKLE describes: "There is a spiritual, a poetic, and for aught we know a spontaneous and uncaused element in the human mind, which ever and anon, suddenly and without warning, gives us a glimpse and a forecast of the future, and urges us to seize the truth as it were by anticipation." (18)

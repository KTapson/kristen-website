My current research includes three practice-based projects, each one centering on an alternative reading of a project by a particular experimental artist or scientist. These projects are Henry S. Fitch's _Autecology of the Copperhead_ (1960), Lee Lozano's daily note-taking practice in the late 1960s, and J.H. van't Hoff's lecture _Imagination in Science_ (1878). In the descriptions that follow, I contextualize these projects and the address some of the ways I understand them to relate to one another.

## Another Autecology of the Copperhead

Working in dialogue with Henry S. Fitch’s Autecology of the Copperhead (1960) and A Kansas Snake Community (1999) and drawing on practices both within and outside scientific knowledge making, Another Autecology of the Copperhead follows nocturnal pit viper routines in Durham, NC each summer while tracking a particular species relationship through a series of new technical and epistemological ecologies.

I take off from Fitch's patient in a rewriting project - 

## Lab Notebook Prototyping

“Art museum on one side & a science frontier research lab on the other.” (Book 5, p. 51)

Lee Lozano's jubilent notetaking practice -- Her particular way of presenting her desire for transparency. Takes her self-experimental ideation seriously as a groundwork for prototyping devices. She is dealing with serious questions. Perhaps most famous for dropping out of the New York scene at what could have been the height of her fame.

My project centers on the published facsimiles of Lozano’s nine small memobooks, which she uses as diaries, day planners, and commonplace books in which she jots down addresses, phone numbers, random thoughts, unit conversions, conversation snippets, reading reflections, unattributed quotes, event reviews, and up-to-the-minute commentary. Her notes from 1968 to 1970 cover more than 300 tiny pages. These are not the notes of an ingenue just landing on the scene; Lozano is 37 when she begins Book 1, 39 when she completes Book 9, and 41 when she edits the entire series of notebooks. She changes her process in Book 4, leaving the back of each page blank for adding notes later. Sometimes she addresses a particular friend, and it is unclear whether she is documenting an actual conversation, making a note-to-self for later, or projecting herself into a conversation and improvising her friend’s presumed response. In other words, we do not know much about the context for many of her notes, even though they often suggest conversational immediacy: “Ed, do you think I’d be bullshitting too much if I said I was studying mathematics? It’s more like I’m studying mathematicians.” (Bk 9, p. 33).

While her art practice seems to necessitate that she compromise herself with her involvement, she is notoriously uncompromising in her choice of materials.

Bk 2: Finding out that the paints are going out of production provokes a question about Lozano’s art practice – re: the discontinuing of shiva standard line of ferrous colors undercurrent of excitement at prospect of being forced to make a change due to circumstances entirely beyond my control.” (p, 29) later, “Decision that I will stop painting when the shiva standard oil ferrous line of colors runs out.” (89)

Necessity of compromising herself as she generates an alternative sign system -- sampling her own mind as she experiments -- 


Lozano’s notes often model her ethical commitments without moralizing. For example, notes such as “all weapons are boomerangs” and “don’t hit back without love” indicate Lozano’s rejection of intentional violence in all of its forms. Humor is a tool she uses to diffuse violence and disrupt normative modes of perception surrounding mundane everyday experiences with an earnest grappling that often emerges, counterintuitively, through the artifice of her project setups.

The project 

       Whoever or whatever designed human beings and all evolutionary forms that led up to them was a bad artist who took the idea of form follows            function to its ultimate disaster. Any rumination about mankind’s shape will disclose how exceedingly ugly a human is ... If we were more              intelligent we would be shaped like spheres which at rest had perhaps smooth reflective surfaces. We could change from solid to liquid to              gaseous states of matter or become nothing but a charge or a force. Our material & color would vary at our will, we’d roll, float or fly.

Lozano elaborates on these notes elsewhere on the same day, and that extended version is collected among her _Language Pieces_. In this version, her first paragraph above is her “prologue,” and it precedes a more substantive dive into what she calls “redesign the human being suggestions”: 

      Substitute a dashboard or a control panel for the face. Let it be easily accessable for scanning by the host as well as other beings. On the           control panel are gauges & dials indicating continuously changing states of temperature, respiration, metabolism, pulserate, heartbeat,               adrenalin count, gonad charge, balance & many other body systems. This info being readily accessible to all might eliminate the peculiarly human       habit of telling lies, the tiresome question “how are you?”

She clearly never invests much in the culture of celebrity or fame, and despite criticism and speculation regarding her mental state, she lives out the ethics to which she commits herself. Amid these decisions, the physics of everyday life that animates her notebook pages never actually materializes as a significant through-line in her work. What she leaves behind in her notebooks, however, is the outline of an unpursued experimental trajectory artist-scientists today can reference and adapt. Undoubtedly, this research trajectory would have been richer had she pursued and documented it herself in the context of her idiosyncratic version of everyday physical science.

## Stereopoetry

He mocks, taunts, and pathologizes van't Hoff. Consistently, he attacks where he perceives weakness. Van't Hoff was just 22 years old when his pamphlet was published. There was no reason for a personal problem, but logic of Kolbe's attack.  ... worth studying in detail.

Kolbe found his ideal model for the "metachemist" pursuing "transcendental chemistry" when the then-unknown J.H. van't Hoff unveiled his theory of the asymmetric carbon atom, the first step toward chemistry considered in three dimensions--soon to be called stereo-chemistry. Van't Hoff, who had studied with Kekule and Wurtz, first found employment at the Utrecht Veterinary College...

Indeed, Kolbe (famously) take aim at van't Hoff's inferior status:

van't Hoff...has no liking, apparently, for exact chemical investigation. He considered it more convenient to mount Pegasus (apparently borred from the Veterinary School) and proclaim in his _'La chimie dans l'espace'_ how, in his bold flight to the top of the chemical Parnassus, the atoms appeared to him to be arranged in cosmic space.

Further, he __

A sketch of the theory was published in Dutch in 1874, and a longer French version appeared the next year. The first enthusiastic advocate of van't Hoff's theory was Johannes Wislicenus, professor at Wurzburg, who was a mid-career structural organic chemist with a fine reputation; he had even published some thoughts on three-dimensional (physical) isomerism himself. Wislicenus asked his student F. Hermann to prepare a German translation of van't Hoff's "Chemistry in Space," wrote an enthusiastic preface, and sold the work to Vieweg Verlag. Kolbe found out about this translation almost immediately because the Vieweg company had a long-established policy of automatically sending proof sheets of all their organic-chemical publications to Kolbe. (Rocke _ )

Wislicenus therefore becomes a figure Kolbe can use to quite elegantly dismiss van't Hoff before reversing the poles and thoroughly dismissing Wislicenus:

As already stated, I would have ignored this paper if not, incomprehensibly, Wislicenus had provided it with a preprinted preface in whihc he, by no means jokingly but quite seriously and warmly, recommended this paper as meritoriious accomplishment .... Wislicenus therefore declares herewith that he has withdrawn from the ranks of exact natural scientists and changed over to the camp of the natural philosophers of ominous remembrance, which are only separated by a thin "medium" from the spiritualists.

Rocke's book nicely contexualizes these events by referencing Kolbe's correspondence during these years. Wislicenus himself intervenes on van't Hoff's behalf in an 1877 letter to Kolbe:

You cannot possibly have studied van't Hoff's essay ... [for] how else could you have reproached me (by logic I do not understand) for a tendency toward spiritualism, or held against the young van't Hoff his position at a veterinary school, or against the translator Herrmann, who was my assistant and solely due to pressing external circumstances accepted a position at the agricultural institute in Heidelberg! I have never doubted that it is a holy zeal for the truth that guides your critical pen; but on the other hand I regret that you do not seem to concede any possibility of your own fallibility, which everyone must grant ... I know that I can err, but I also know that I have no cause to allow myself to be struck from the ranks of exact scientists, for I as well as you have the will to serve the truth ... (332-33).

Kolbe assumes he knows the right answer, so he exerts control to enforce his worldview. But he ends up being wrong about the science. An entirely new field is opening up.

In _Imagination in Science_, van't Hoff first defines experiment and asserts its value. That is, he spends no time arguing for the validity of his theory or directly championing it. Kolbe's main problem with van't Hoff seems to be the lack of what he considered to be sufficient empirical evidence to support a paradigm-altering theory. Van't Hoff's theory was indeed based on published--and therefore very real--experimental data. Kolbe, delimiting the terms of the possible, essentially puts forward the argument that van't hoff did not have the kind of impressive university position or experience in the discipline that would be necessary to truly understand the limits of the field. Concomitant with an understanding of the limits of the field would be an understanding of the limits of knowledge. Thus, what seemed to particularly anger Kolbe was the "insolence" with which van't Hoff synthesized published data in order to project to a new theory and therefore a new domain of experimentation and investigation. Van't Hoff's theory threatened not only Kolbe's worldview but also his methodology. Experiment, in other words, was Kolbe's domain.


Newton always was afraid that an accident would befall him in a carriage and thus held himself onto the door. Kepler's conception of the universe was most peculiar; he seriously believed the earth to be a reptile and that the planets which surround the earth produce a melodious chord by their movement (Jupiter and Saturn form the bass, Mars the tenor, and so on. ()

Van't Hoff mentions these "to delineate what is to be understood by a deranged expression of fantasy" ().

At the end of a biography Cuvier once compared two great chemists, VAUQUELIN and DAVY; he expressed himself         about as follows: “Notwithstanding his innumerable investigations and in spite of the important and noteworthy     observations with which VAUQUELIN enlarged the stock of scientific knowledge, he cannot be considered as of the     same caliber as DAVY. The former put his name in the paragraphs; the latter in the titles of each chapter. In a     completely unpretentious manner, the former observed with a lantern the smallest obscurities and penetrated into the darkest nooks; the latter ascended like an eagle and illuminated the large realm of physics and           chemistry with a shining beacon.” (18)
    
Following this comparison between Vauquelin and Davy, van't Hoff concludes his lecture with unmitigated optimism:
    
I make these words my own in order to describe what research is without imagination, and what it can be if one uses  it in an admissible manner. VAUQUELIN did not appear in the two classifications above; DAVY, however, did in both as poet as well as visionary. His discoveries were the fruits of that great gift which [H.T.] BUCKLE describes: "There is a spiritual, a poetic, and for aught we know a spontaneous and uncaused element in the human mind, which ever and anon, suddenly and without warning, gives us a glimpse and a forecast of the future, and urges us to seize the truth as it were by anticipation." (18)

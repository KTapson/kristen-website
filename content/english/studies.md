My current research is organized by three practice-based projects, each one centering on an alternative reading of the work of a particular scientist or artist. I call these projects _Another Autecology of the Copperhead_, Lab Notebook Prototyping, and Stereopoetry.

## Another Autecology of the Copperhead

Working in dialogue with Henry S. Fitch’s Autecology of the Copperhead (1960) and A Kansas Snake Community (1999) and drawing on practices both within and outside scientific knowledge making, Another Autecology of the Copperhead follows nocturnal pit viper routines in Durham, NC each summer while tracking a particular species relationship through a series of new technical and epistemological ecologies.

I take off from Fitch's patient in a rewriting project - 

## Lab Notebook Prototyping

“Art museum on one side & a science frontier research lab on the other.” (Book 5, p. 51)

Lee Lozano's jubilent notetaking practice -- Her particular way of presenting her desire for transparency. Takes her self-experimental ideation seriously as a groundwork for prototyping devices. She is dealing with serious questions. Perhaps most famous for dropping out of the New York scene at what could have been the height of her fame.

My project centers on the published facsimiles of Lozano’s nine small memobooks, which she uses as diaries, day planners, and commonplace books in which she jots down addresses, phone numbers, random thoughts, unit conversions, conversation snippets, reading reflections, unattributed quotes, event reviews, and up-to-the-minute commentary. Her notes from 1968 to 1970 cover more than 300 tiny pages. These are not the notes of an ingenue just landing on the scene; Lozano is 37 when she begins Book 1, 39 when she completes Book 9, and 41 when she edits the entire series of notebooks. She changes her process in Book 4, leaving the back of each page blank for adding notes later. Sometimes she addresses a particular friend, and it is unclear whether she is documenting an actual conversation, making a note-to-self for later, or projecting herself into a conversation and improvising her friend’s presumed response. In other words, we do not know much about the context for many of her notes, even though they often suggest conversational immediacy: “Ed, do you think I’d be bullshitting too much if I said I was studying mathematics? It’s more like I’m studying mathematicians.” (Bk 9, p. 33).

While her art practice seems to necessitate that she compromise herself with her involvement, she is notoriously uncompromising in her choice of materials.

Bk 2: Finding out that the paints are going out of production provokes a question about Lozano’s art practice – re: the discontinuing of shiva standard line of ferrous colors undercurrent of excitement at prospect of being forced to make a change due to circumstances entirely beyond my control.” (p, 29) later, “Decision that I will stop painting when the shiva standard oil ferrous line of colors runs out.” (89)



Lozano’s notes often model her ethical commitments but they do not moralize. For example, notes such as “all weapons are boomerangs” and “don’t hit back without love” indicate Lozano’s rejection of intentional violence in all of its forms. Humor is a tool she uses to diffuse violence and disrupt normative modes of perception surrounding mundane everyday experiences with a jubilant and earnest grappling that often emerges, counterintuitively, through the artifice of her project setups.

       Whoever or whatever designed human beings and all evolutionary forms that led up to them was a bad artist who took the idea of form follows            function to its ultimate disaster. Any rumination about mankind’s shape will disclose how exceedingly ugly a human is ... If we were more              intelligent we would be shaped like spheres which at rest had perhaps smooth reflective surfaces. We could change from solid to liquid to              gaseous states of matter or become nothing but a charge or a force. Our material & color would vary at our will, we’d roll, float or fly.

Lozano elaborates on these notes elsewhere on the same day, and that extended version is collected among her Language Pieces. In this version, her first paragraph above is her “prologue,” and it precedes a more substantive dive into what she calls “redesign the human being suggestions.” 

      Substitute a dashboard or a control panel for the face. Let it be easily accessable for scanning by the host as well as other beings. On the           control panel are gauges & dials indicating continuously changing states of temperature, respiration, metabolism, pulserate, heartbeat,               adrenalin count, gonad charge, balance & many other body systems. This info being readily accessible to all might eliminate the peculiarly human       habit of telling lies, the tiresome question “how are you?”

She clearly never invests much in the culture of celebrity or fame, and despite criticism and speculation regarding her mental state, she lives out the ethics to which she commits herself. Amid these decisions, the physics of everyday life that animates her notebook pages never actually materializes as a significant through-line in her work. What she leaves behind in her notebooks, however, is the outline of an unpursued experimental trajectory artist-scientists today can reference and adapt. Undoubtedly, this research trajectory would have been richer had she pursued and documented it herself in the context of her idiosyncratic version of everyday physical science.



## Stereopoetry

Description2
    At the end of a biography Cuvier once compared two great chemists, VAUQUELIN and DAVY; he expressed himself about as follows: “Notwithstanding         observations with which VAUQUELIN enlarged the stock of scientific knowledge, he cannot be considered as of the same caliber as DAVY. The former       put his name in the paragraphs; the latter in the titles of each chapter. In a completely unpretentious manner, the former observed with a lantern     the smallest obscurities and penetrated into the darkest nooks; the latter ascended like an eagle and illuminated the large realm of physics and       chemistry with a shining beacon.”
    
Following this comparison between Vauquelin and Davy, van't Hoff concludes his lecture with unmitigated optimism:
    
    I make these words my own in order to describe what research is without imagination, and what it can be if one uses it in an admissible manner.       VAUQUELIN did not appear in the two classifications above; Davy, however, did in both as poet as well as visionary. His discoveries were the           fruits of that great gift which BUCKLE describes: “There is a spiritual, a poetic, and for aught we know a spontaneous and uncaused element in         the human mind, which ever and anon, suddenly and without warning, gives us a glimpse and a forecast of the future, and urges us to seize the         truth as if it were by anticipation.”

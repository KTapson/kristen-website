My current research includes three practice-based projects, each one centering on an alternative reading of a project by a particular experimental artist or scientist. These projects are Henry S. Fitch's _Autecology of the Copperhead_ (1960), Lee Lozano's daily notebooks from the late 1960s, and J.H. van't Hoff's theory of the tetrahedral carbon and his related lecture _Imagination in Science_ (1878). In the descriptions that follow, I contextualize these projects and the address some of the ways I understand them to relate to one another.

## Another Autecology of the Copperhead

Working in dialogue with Henry S. Fitch’s Autecology of the Copperhead (1960) and A Kansas Snake Community (1999) and drawing on practices both within and outside scientific knowledge making, Another Autecology of the Copperhead follows nocturnal pit viper routines in Durham, NC each summer while tracking a particular species relationship through a series of new technical and epistemological ecologies.

I take off from Fitch's patient in a rewriting project - 

## Lab Notebook Prototyping

“Art museum on one side & a science frontier research lab on the other.”
- Lee Lozano, _Private Book 5_, p. 51

Lee Lozano's jubilent notetaking practice -- Her particular way of presenting her desire for transparency. Takes her self-experimental ideation seriously as a groundwork for prototyping devices. She is dealing with serious questions. Perhaps most famous for dropping out of the New York scene at what could have been the height of her fame.

calls herself a highentist - get rid of gravity.

My approach to Lozano's work focuses on the published facsimiles of her nine small memobooks, which she uses as diaries, day planners, and commonplace books in which she jots down addresses, phone numbers, random thoughts, unit conversions, conversation snippets, reading reflections, unattributed quotes, event reviews, and up-to-the-minute commentary. Her notes from 1968 to 1970 cover more than 300 tiny pages. These are not the notes of an ingenue just landing on the scene; Lozano is 37 when she begins Book 1, 39 when she completes Book 9, and 41 when she edits the entire series of notebooks. She changes her process in Book 4, leaving the back of each page blank for adding notes later. Sometimes she addresses a particular friend, and it is unclear whether she is documenting an actual conversation, making a note-to-self for later, or projecting herself into a conversation and improvising her friend’s presumed response. In other words, we do not know much about the context for many of her notes, even though they often suggest conversational immediacy: “Ed, do you think I’d be bullshitting too much if I said I was studying mathematics? It’s more like I’m studying mathematicians.” (Bk 9, p. 33).

While her art practice necessitates that she "compromise" herself repeatedly by subjecting herself to self-experimental conditions imposed by daily life, she is notoriously uncompromising in her choice of materials. Finding out that her favorite paints are going out of production leads her to completely rethink the future of her art practice: "re the discontinuing of shiva standard line of ferrous colors: undercurrent of excitement at prospect of being forced to make a change due to circumstances entirely beyond my control” (Private Book 2, 29). Later, she writes, “Decision that I will stop painting when the shiva standard oil ferrous line of colors runs out” (89).

Necessity of compromising herself as she generates an alternative sign system -- sampling her own mind as she experiments -- 

Found poetry in Mayer's _The Art of Science Writing_ : __

Lozano’s notes often model her ethical commitments without moralizing or imposing them on others. For example, notes such as “all weapons are boomerangs” and “don’t hit back without love” indicate Lozano’s rejection of intentional violence in all of its forms. Humor is a tool she uses to diffuse the imposition of end-directed controls and to disrupt normative modes of perception surrounding mundane everyday experiences with an earnest grappling that emerges, counterintuitively, through the artifice of her project setups.

My project takes Lozano's   Notes that appear in Private Book __ and -- her reimagining of human form.

Proposes technologically-mediated forms of transparency

Middle-of-the-night thoughts: “Random cant-sleep-due-to-brain-overload-thoughts: since I’ve been consuming much more oil in my diet(& on my body) I seem to be getting more transparent. (oil spots on paper are transparent, etc). Want more transparency! (See Light Piece & fantasy abt matter becoming more transparent the more light on it. Also description of lit rose, Physics Today BK review) Emotions/needs/ideas --> More transparent! – (book 7)

Whoever or whatever designed human beings and all evolutionary forms that led up to them was a bad artist who took the idea of form follows            function to its ultimate disaster. Any rumination about mankind’s shape will disclose how exceedingly ugly a human is ... If we were more              intelligent we would be shaped like spheres which at rest had perhaps smooth reflective surfaces. We could change from solid to liquid to              gaseous states of matter or become nothing but a charge or a force. Our material & color would vary at our will, we’d roll, float or fly.

She elaborates on these notes elsewhere on the same day, and that extended version is collected among her _Language Pieces_. In this version, her first paragraph above is her “prologue,” and it precedes a more substantive dive into what she calls “redesign the human being suggestions”: 

Substitute a dashboard or a control panel for the face. Let it be easily accessable for scanning by the host as well as other beings. On the           control panel are gauges & dials indicating continuously changing states of temperature, respiration, metabolism, pulserate, heartbeat,               adrenalin count, gonad charge, balance & many other body systems. This info being readily accessible to all might eliminate the peculiarly human       habit of telling lies, the tiresome question “how are you?” ()

Thinking Lozano's project in terms of bioengineering and the ways living organisms can participate in circuits 

Lozano clearly never invests much in the culture of celebrity or fame, and despite criticism and speculation regarding her mental state, she lives out the ethics to which she commits herself. Perhaps as a result, the physics of everyday life that animates her notebook pages never actually materializes as a significant through-line in her work. What she leaves behind in her notebooks, however, is the outline of an unpursued experimental trajectory artist-scientists today can pick up, reference, and adapt. Through her self-sampling and sustained interest in _matter_, for example, she repeatedly glimpses the beginnings of alternative sign systems. Undoubtedly, this research trajectory would have been richer had she pursued and documented it herself in the context of her idiosyncratic version of everyday physical science.

## Stereopoetry

Controversial history of the reception of .

Connectivity dictates shape -- without a thorough consideration of shape, it is impossible to understand the bigger picture of meaning. Spatial relationship as an organizing - same connectivity but different orientation in space gives rise to different properties. Reaching back to a fundamental of matter. My project for the spring exhibition is to 

To interject some personal narrative into this project: in my first semester of graduate school, I wrote an essay historicizing the concept of imagination across literary and scientific texts for my cohort's proseminar. (At the time of the presentation, I was 22 years old). I presented a hybrid science- I remember the room got very quiet afterward. We had been talking about literary theory all semester. Finally, a friend gently suggested that I should return to Derrida's critique of Levi-Strauss. She was too nice to say so explicitly, but the implication was that my project was hopelessly regressive in its attempt to illuminate a key moment in the history of structural organic chemistry and collide it with - as a way of understanding . A new new structuralism. I thought my friends were probably right. So I dropped it, and I _was_ able to complicate my .

Now, when I am mentoring students, I take great pleasure in sharing good advice from my training when you are working in a space or a sign system that might quickly, and incorrectly, subsume novelty under existing frameworks. that  I "generate the criteria for your own reception"--a quote I always properly attribute--and I have watched with pleasure as my students react with enthusiasm to this prospect, often writing it down. 

Alan J. Rocke's sympathetic book on German chemist Hermann Kolbe helpfully contextualizes the circumstances surrounding the controversial reception of van't Hoff's theory:

A sketch of the theory was published in Dutch in 1874, and a longer French version appeared the next year. The first enthusiastic advocate of van't Hoff's theory was Johannes Wislicenus, professor at Wurzburg, who was a mid-career structural organic chemist with a fine reputation; he had even published some thoughts on three-dimensional (physical) isomerism himself. Wislicenus asked his student F. Hermann to prepare a German translation of van't Hoff's "Chemistry in Space," wrote an enthusiastic preface, and sold the work to Vieweg Verlag. Kolbe found out about this translation almost immediately because the Vieweg company had a long-established policy of automatically sending proof sheets of all their organic-chemical publications to Kolbe. (328)

In short, Kolbe mocks, taunts, and pathologizes van't Hoff in print. Consistently, he attacks where he perceives weakness. While I am not interested in emphasizing the terms of Kolbe's sustained criticism, I do want to draw attention to the details of the situation's unfolding in order to then refocus attention on how van't Hoff later addresses the nature of experimentation. As Rocke points out, van't Hoff embodied a particularly infuriating form of researcher to Kolbe: "Kolbe found his ideal model for the "metachemist" pursuing "transcendental chemistry" when the then-unknown J.H. van't Hoff unveiled his theory of the asymmetric carbon atom, the first step toward chemistry considered in three dimensions--soon to be called stereo-chemistry" (328).

Famously, Kolbe takes aim at van't Hoff in lively, personal terms:

A Dr. J.H. van't Hoff who is employed at the Veterinary School in Utrecht appears to find exact chemical research not suiting his taste. He deems it more convenient to mount Pegasus (apparently borrowed from the Veterinary School) and proclaim in his _'La chimie dans l'espace'_ how, in his bold flight to the top of the chemical Parnassus, the atoms appeared to him to be arranged in cosmic space. (329)

In other words, Kolbe clearly has great fun with van't Hoff's inferior position. (The modern-day equivalent of such a status-oriented dismissal might be something like using the term "adjunct professor" as a pejorative, though we might expect it to be less memorable than the image Kolbe offers). He states that van't Hoff's pamphlet "teems with fantastic trifles" and "it is completely impossible to criticize [it] in any detail because the fancy trifles in it are totally devoid of any factual reality and are completely incomprehensible to any clear-minded resarcher" (6-7). "It is a sign of the times," he writes, "that modern chemists feel the urge and capability to have an explanation for everything and if gained experience does not suffice, then they are perfectly happy to invoke supernatural explanations" (7). Even Wislicenus, mentioned above for his good reputation, becomes a figure Kolbe can use to dismiss van't Hoff before reversing the poles and thoroughly dismissing Wislicenus:

As already stated, I would have ignored this paper if not, incomprehensibly, Wislicenus had provided it with a preprinted preface in which he, by no means jokingly but quite seriously and warmly, recommended this paper as meritorious accomplishment .... Wislicenus therefore declares herewith that he has withdrawn from the ranks of exact natural scientists and changed over to the camp of the natural philosophers of ominous remembrance, which are only separated by a thin "medium" from the spiritualists.

As Rocke demonstrates, the controversy becomes a key topic in the scientific correspondence at the time. Wislicenus, in fact, intervenes directly on van't Hoff's behalf in an 1877 letter to Kolbe:

You cannot possibly have studied van't Hoff's essay ... [for] how else could you have reproached me (by logic I do not understand) for a tendency toward spiritualism, or held against the young van't Hoff his position at a veterinary school, or against the translator Herrmann, who was my assistant and solely due to pressing external circumstances accepted a position at the agricultural institute in Heidelberg! I have never doubted that it is a holy zeal for the truth that guides your critical pen; but on the other hand I regret that you do not seem to concede any possibility of your own fallibility, which everyone must grant ... I know that I can err, but I also know that I have no cause to allow myself to be struck from the ranks of exact scientists, for I as well as you have the will to serve the truth ... (332-33).

Kolbe also elsewhere rails against to August Kekule--who is perhaps most well known now for his dream of a snake eating its tail and subsequent conceptualization of the ring shape of benzene--and draws Jacob Volhard into the fray: 

And as for the form, I ask you: What do you care about Kekule's style or his classical education? Consideration for K's scientific accomplishments, indeed mere collegial respect ought to have stopped you from treating this man as if you were a teacher looking over a schoolboy's assignments and correcting his mistakes .... I beseech you, no more such intemperate critiques! More tolerance and respect for scientists who have made and are still making their contributions! (332)

Time and time again, Kolbe begins with an assumption about the right answer and correct outcome, then he exerts his authority and control to enforce his worldview regardless of the cost. But, importantly here, he ends up being wrong about the science. A new field was opening up.  

Van't Hoff most famously addresses Kolbe's criticism in 1878 in the inaugural lecture upon his appointment to the faculty at the University of Amersterdam. He calls this lecture [_Imagination in Science_](https://www.ias.ac.in/public/Volumes/reso/012/05/0088-0100.pdf). To begin, he reads Kolbe's criticism in full. Then, he pivots: "Here is not the place to discuss further this vast divergence of views; nevertheless, I have mentioned it, since it formed the main reason for the choice of my subject: Imagination in Science.

In the first half of his talk, van't Hoff defines experiment and asserts its value. That is, he does not spend any time arguing for the validity of his theory of the asymmetric carbon or directly championing it. Kolbe's main problem with van't Hoff seems to be the lack of what he considered to be sufficient empirical evidence to support a paradigm-altering theory. Van't Hoff's theory was indeed based on published--and therefore very real--experimental data. Kolbe, delimiting the terms of the possible, essentially puts forward the argument that van't hoff did not have the kind of impressive university position or experience in the discipline that would be necessary to truly understand the limits of the field. Concomitant with an understanding of the limits of the field would be an understanding of the limits of knowledge. Thus, what seemed to particularly anger Kolbe was the "insolence" with which van't Hoff synthesized published data in order to project to a new theory and therefore a new domain of experimentation and investigation. Van't Hoff's theory threatened not only Kolbe's worldview but also his methodology. Experiment, in other words, was Kolbe's domain.

Van’t Hoff begins by directly addressesing the definition of experiment, summarizing the scope of his talk as “_The role of the imagination in investigating the connection between cause and effect_” (8). He situates the terms of experiment as he understands them and presents examples from the history of science that illustrate limit cases and innovations. He references the logic by which Helmholtz invents the ophthalmoscope, for instance, exemplifying a productive "synergism of imagination and critical judgment":  

There is a difficulty which makes it impossible to observe the retina through the pupil although the latter is completely translucent. The difficulty is that precisely during observation, as the idiom states, one stands in one's own light. A flame put between the observed and the observing eye would illuminate the former but make its observation impossible. The _thought occurred to Helmholtz's mind_ to place between both eyes a small mirror with a small aperture in such a way that a lateral light beam would fall in the subject's eye which now can be observed through the aperture. (9-10)

Imagination, van't Hoff argues, "plays a role both in the ability to do scientific research as well as in the urge to exploit this capability" (12). Summarizing the results of an inquiry into the biographies of famous scientists across history, he points out that two criteria characterize the scientists who contributed the most significant theories and discoveries to their fields: first, _artistic inclinations_, and second, (what van't Hoff calls) _the diseased imagination_ (15). With regard to the former, he surveys great scientists' enthusiasm and talents for poetry, storytelling, and theatre. With regard to the latter, he notes that "examples of the most bizarre imagination, superstition, spiritualism, hallucinations, even insanity, occur not infrequently in the examined biographies (15-16). As he continues, the examples become quite strange: "Newton always was afraid that an accident would befall him in a carriage and thus held himself onto the door. Kepler's conception of the universe was most peculiar; he seriously believed the earth to be a reptile and that the planets which surround the earth produce a melodious chord by their movement (Jupiter and Saturn form the bass, Mars the tenor, and so on)." 

Finally, van't Hoff turns to the current state of scientific research, arguing that the expanding field of researchers changes both the pathway to scientific discovery and the role of the imagination in conducting scientific work. Imagination has become less necessary to the scientific enterprise: "If the diaphragm, which plays the predominant role in breathing, is artificially paralyzed, then the chest takes over for a while the work of the diaphragm as best it can. If imagination is lacking, then one tries by other means to compensate for this deficiency" (17).

He concludes the talk with a comparison between the biographies of two scientists:

At the end of a biography CUVIER once compared two great chemists, VAUQUELIN and DAVY; he expressed himself         about as follows: “Notwithstanding his innumerable investigations and in spite of the important and noteworthy     observations with which VAUQUELIN enlarged the stock of scientific knowledge, he cannot be considered as of the     same caliber as DAVY. The former put his name in the paragraphs; the latter in the titles of each chapter. In a     completely unpretentious manner, the former observed with a lantern the smallest obscurities and penetrated into the darkest nooks; the latter ascended like an eagle and illuminated the large realm of physics and           chemistry with a shining beacon.” (18)
    
Following this comparison between the experimental contributions of Vauquelin and Davy, van't Hoff expresses unmitigated optimism:
    
I make these words my own in order to describe what research is without imagination, and what it can be if one uses  it in an admissible manner. VAUQUELIN did not appear in the two classifications above; DAVY, however, did in both as poet as well as visionary. His discoveries were the fruits of that great gift which [H.T.] BUCKLE describes: "There is a spiritual, a poetic, and for aught we know a spontaneous and uncaused element in the human mind, which ever and anon, suddenly and without warning, gives us a glimpse and a forecast of the future, and urges us to seize the truth as it were by anticipation." (18)
